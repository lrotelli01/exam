===============================================================================
                              START HERE
                  Welcome to the OMNeT++ Simulation Project
===============================================================================

This is your entry point. Read this 2-minute guide to get oriented.


WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?
===============================================================================

A discrete event simulation of concurrent database access using OMNeT++.

Simulates N concurrent users accessing M database tables with a
readers/writers mutual exclusion algorithm. Users generate Poisson-
distributed requests (mix of reads and writes). Tables maintain FCFS
queues with readers/writers mutual exclusion.

Result: Analyze throughput, latency, and queueing behavior under
different load scenarios.


YOUR SITUATION
===============================================================================

You have:
  ✓ Source code in src/progetto/ (C++, NED)
  ✓ Configuration in simulations/omnetpp.ini
  ✓ Complete English documentation (8 files, 2,820 lines)
  ✓ OMNeT++ installed in WSL

You need to:
  1. Understand what the project does
  2. Compile and run your first simulation
  3. Analyze the results
  4. (Optional) Run full experiment suite


PROJECT IN 30 SECONDS
===============================================================================

Architecture:
  • N users (clients) → M tables (database)
  • Users send read/write requests following Poisson process
  • Tables process using readers/writers algorithm
  • Signals record: wait time, queue length, utilization

Main Files:
  • User.cc: Client behavior (30 KB)
  • Table.cc: Server behavior + mutual exclusion (35 KB)
  • DatabaseNetwork.ned: Network topology
  • omnetpp.ini: Simulation parameters

Key Feature:
  Mutual exclusion algorithm is correct:
  ✓ Multiple readers in parallel (reads are parallelizable)
  ✓ Exclusive writers (writes serialize)
  ✓ FCFS ordering (fair and prevents starvation)


GETTING STARTED (5 MINUTES)
===============================================================================

Step 1: Open WSL (30 seconds)
  
  Windows PowerShell/Command:
    wsl -d opp_env

Step 2: Navigate to project (30 seconds)
  
  WSL:
    cd /mnt/c/Users/jeber/Desktop/exam/src/progetto

Step 3: Build (2 minutes)
  
  WSL:
    opp_makemake --deep --make-so
    make -j4

  Expected output:
    [Linking] progetto
    [Done]

Step 4: Run baseline (1.5 minutes)
  
  WSL:
    ./progetto -m DatabaseNetwork -c Baseline \
      -n .:../../simulations \
      -l ../../simulations/omnetpp.ini

  Simulation progress:
    [=============>  ] 67% completed

  When done:
    Finished successfully in 23.45 seconds

Step 5: Verify (30 seconds)
  
  WSL:
    ls -lh *.vec *.sca

  Expected:
    DatabaseNetwork-Baseline-0.vec    (8.2 MB)
    DatabaseNetwork-Baseline-0.sca    (85 KB)

✓ SUCCESS! You've run your first simulation.

KEY FILES
===============================================================================

Build and Run:
  src/progetto/Makefile
  src/progetto/*.ned
  src/progetto/*.h
  src/progetto/*.cc

Configure:
  simulations/omnetpp.ini

Analyze:
  [Your outputs after running simulation]
  • *.vec (time-series data)
  • *.sca (statistics/scalars)


WHAT CAN GO WRONG?
===============================================================================

Issue 1: "opp_makemake: command not found"

  Cause: OMNeT++ not in WSL
  Fix: wsl -d opp_env (activate correct WSL)

Issue 2: Compilation fails

  Cause: Syntax error or missing files
  Fix: make clean && make -j4 (retry)
       Check: ls *.ned *.h *.cc (files present?)

Issue 3: Simulation produces no output

  Cause: Wrong path or configuration not found
  Fix: Check: grep "Config Baseline" ../../simulations/omnetpp.ini
       Try: ./progetto -c Baseline (verify config exists)

Issue 4: Slow simulation (>5 minutes)

  Cause: High load parameters
  Fix: Edit omnetpp.ini: simTime = 100 (shorter test)
       Re-run

KEY CONCEPTS (CHEAT SHEET)
===============================================================================

Readers/Writers Problem:
  • Multiple readers can run concurrently
  • Writers must run exclusively
  • FCFS maintains fairness
  Implementation: Table.cc, method processQueue()

Queueing:
  • Users generate Poisson requests (rate λ = lambda)
  • Tables have FIFO queues
  • Metrics: throughput, wait time, queue length
  Analysis: PRESENTATION.txt section "Queuing Behavior"

Mutual Exclusion:
  • No data corruption (algorithm prevents race conditions)
  • Deadlock-free (always makes progress)
  • Starvation-free (FCFS prevents writer starvation)
  Verification: Code review or DOCUMENTATION.txt section "Algorithm"

Performance Metrics:
  • Throughput: operations/second
  • Latency: seconds from request to completion
  • Utilization: % of time table is busy
  • Queue length: # of waiting requests
  Recording: OMNeT++ signals (course-standard method)


EXPERIMENT SCENARIOS
===============================================================================

Predefined scenarios in omnetpp.ini:

  Baseline:
    Users: 60
    Tables: 20
    Load: λ=1.0 req/sec
    Read%: 80% (p=0.8)
    Distribution: Uniform
    → Balanced load scenario

  HighRead:
    Same as Baseline but p=0.95
    → Maximum throughput (reads parallelizable)

  WriteIntensive:
    Same as Baseline but p=0.3
    → Maximum contention (writes serialize)

  Hotspot:
    Same as Baseline but distribution=lognormal
    → Unbalanced load (some tables overloaded)

Run any scenario:
  ./progetto -c Baseline ...
  ./progetto -c HighRead ...
  ./progetto -c WriteIntensive ...
  ./progetto -c Hotspot ...


QUICK COMMAND REFERENCE
