Project 4 – Concurrent database access
A database consists of � tables and is accessed concurrently by � users performing read or write
operations. Each user accesses one table of the database every � seconds, where � is an
exponentially distributed random variable. The index of the accessed table � is an IID random
variable whose distribution is specified below. Each access is a read operation with probability �
and a write operation with probability 1 − �, and they have fixed duration of � seconds.
Multiple read operations on the same table can be performed simultaneously, whereas write
operations on a table must be executed in mutual exclusion, i.e., other read or write operations on
the same table must be serialized when another write operation is being executed. Waiting
operations are inserted in per-table queues and served according to First Come First Served (FCFS)
policy. Note that if a read operation on a table arrives when there is at least one pending write
operation for that table, the read operation must wait anyway.
Evaluate at least the number of served accesses per unit time for various values of � and � in the
following scenario(s):
- uniform distribution of �
- lognormal distribution of �
In all cases, it is up to the team to calibrate the scenarios so that meaningful results are obtained.
