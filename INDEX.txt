KEY CONCEPTS REFERENCE
===============================================================================

Readers/Writers Problem:
  Multiple readers can access table simultaneously
  Writers require exclusive access

  No starvation, deadlock-free
  See: Table.h/cc implementation, PRESENTATION.txt slide 5

Queueing Theory:
  Poisson process for arrivals (Poisson parameter λ)
  Exponential inter-arrival times
  M/M/1 queue approximation
  See: DOCUMENTATION.txt section "Queueing Theory"

Signal Mechanism (OMNeT++):
  registerSignal(): Declare metric
  emit(): Record value
  @signal/@statistic in NED files
  See: User.cc, Table.cc, *.ned files

Experimental Design:
  Baseline scenario: N=60, M=20, λ=1.0, p=0.8
  Variants: Different N, λ, p values
  Multi-factor experiments: Combine factors
  See: omnetpp.ini, WORKFLOW.txt section 5

Performance Metrics:
  Throughput: Operations per second
  Latency: Wait time from request to completion
  Queue length: Congestion indicator
